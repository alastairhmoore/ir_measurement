# ir_measurement
Matlab tools for making impulse response measurements


# Pre-requisites
Download and compile the source for `playrec` from https://github.com/PlayrecForMatlab/playrec.

# Getting started
Open `demo_script.m` and have a look at the basic commands

1. `setup.m` does some path configuration and allows you to set the soundcard
2. `test_signals.m` generates a tone to check the levels
3. `getSysIR.m` is the main function by which impulse response measurements are made
